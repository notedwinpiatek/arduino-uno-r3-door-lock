# Arduino Uno R3 Door Lock System

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective door lock system built with an Arduino Uno R3, a 4x4 keypad for user input, a 16x2 I2C LCD for visual feedback, and a servo motor to act as the locking mechanism. The system allows users to enter a pin code via the keypad to unlock the door, providing a practical introduction to integrating various electronic components and coding them to work together.
