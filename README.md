# arduino-uno-r3-door-lock
This project demonstrates a simple door lock system using an Arduino Uno R3, a 4x4 keypad for input, a 16x2 I2C LCD for feedback, and a servo motor for the lock mechanism. The system allows users to enter a pin code via the keypad to unlock the door, showcasing basic integration of components and coding.
